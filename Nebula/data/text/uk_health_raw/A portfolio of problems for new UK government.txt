Brexit

As victory cheers ring in the ears of the newly elected British government the ‘B’ word will loom large from minute one as negotiations on the terms of Britain’s departure from the European Union begin in earnest on June 19th.

It is the single greatest challenge faced by a British government since the Second World War.

In her election campaign Theresa May banged home the slogan ‘strong and stable’ but where is the strength in doing a deal with 27 united EU members states represented by the European Commission and what is stable about an uncertain future. 

An amicable divorce, a hard Brexit, a soft Brexit, a grey Brexit, Brexit means Brexit.

Security

The recent terrorist murders in London and Manchester have plunged the issue of UK security into the heart of the political debate.

And under the microscope Conservative cuts to frontline policing.

Since 2010 there are 20,000 less police officers on the streets not to mention similar cuts to backroom civilian staff.

May insists the force is “well resourced” and has made no mention of any additional staff.

Labour says it will provide funds for 10,000 new on the beat bobbies. 

National Health Service 

The NHS poses a perinneial political problem.
Costs are going one way and that is up, the factors are not necessarily in the hands of politicians.
An aging and growing population, along with evolving healthcare issues such as obesity, diabetes and antibiotic resistance.

The Nuffield Trust estimates that 17,000 more hospital beds are needed by 2022 and staff morale is at all time low.
