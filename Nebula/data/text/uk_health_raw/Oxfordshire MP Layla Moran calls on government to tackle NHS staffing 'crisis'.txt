Oxfordshire MP Layla Moran calls on government to tackle NHS staffing 'crisis'

Author: Chris Ord

AN Oxfordshire MP has called on the Government to tackle the county’s potentially crippling NHS staffing ‘crisis’.

Oxford West and Abingdon MP Layla Moran will be raising the issue in a House of Commons debate this morning, where she will call for more funding for Oxfordshire’s health services.

Ms Moran said the three main drivers for the difficulties facing the NHS were underfunding, the cut to nursing bursaries and professional development, and the cost of living in Oxfordshire.

The MP secured the debate after a leaked memo revealed doctors at Oxford University Hospitals (OUH) NHS Foundation Trust was considering 'rationing' some cancer treatments because of a lack of qualified nursing staff.

She said: “It’s clearly concerning that the NHS is having to think about how it might ration treatments or services because it might not have the right people to do the job.”

“We cannot and should not allow this situation to continue unchecked, so this week I’ve secured a debate on ‘the recruitment and retention of NHS in staff in Oxfordshire’.

“We need some answers from the Government about what they are going to do about it.”

Calls to lift the NHS pay cap will also be made.

The debate will take place today from 11.30am.
