Just In: President Trump Sends Help To Save A 10-Month-Old Baby’s Life

Author:

President Donald Trump is constantly proving that he is the best president that America has ever seen. Even though Democrats are trying to bring him down, the true Americans recognize his real power and respect.

President Donald Trump during the presidential campaign made few major promises, and he is prepared to keep all of them. He has found out the perfect solution for the biggest problems in our country, but sadly the Democrats were here to block it. Trump cannot make a decision without being attacked and criticized by them.

Hollywood celebrities are motivating these attacks. They are mocking the President publicly and even provoking violence. And Snoop Dog and Kathy Griffin have done the worst acts of promoting violence. He released a video in which he shoots a clown that looks like President Trump, and she posed with the bloody head of the President.

So now what will the Democrats say about the President’s attempt to save Charlie Gard. NHC left the UK baby to die, and the hospital didn’t approve his transfer to the United States. This was a shocking scandal, and President Trump offered to help.

“If we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the UK and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so,” President Trump wrote on Twitter.

Charlie Gard is a 10-month-old baby, and the UK court thinks that the life support machine should be turned off.

Democrats say that President Trump is trying to divert everyone’s attention from the problems with the health care bill.
